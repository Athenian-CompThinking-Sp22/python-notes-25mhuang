# first value in for loop tells starting point
# second value in for loop tells ending point (ends before it)
# third value in for loop tells change increment
# 'continue' tells loop to move on/do nothing

# Write your code here:

for num in range(10, 0, -1):
    if num == num:
        print('Halfway There')
    else:
        print(num)
# counts from 10-1 and prints halfway msg when there

# for letter in 'Mississippi':
#     if letter == 's':
#         continue
#     elif letter == 'p':
#         break
#     else:
#         print(letter)
# prints letters in word besides 's' and stops the program when it's 'p'
